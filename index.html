				<h2>What do we need from you</h2>
				<p>
					Improved comfort. Right-sized air conditioners deliver smaller volumes of air over longer periods of time.
				</p>
				<p>
					Better humidity control. In order for air conditioners to dehumidify, they have to cycle long enough for moisture to condense on the coils and drain away. 
					Quieter home. Noise reduction: less start & stop, air moves slower through ducts and registers, smaller compressor and fan motors. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Lower energy bills. Oversized AC prevent air conditioners from operating at peak efficiency. Thus, right-sized units provide an equivalent amount of space cooling for less energy consumed. Fewer maintenance problems. The maintenance frequency can be increased while lives can be shortened.
